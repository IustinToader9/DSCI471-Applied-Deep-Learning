My implementation of DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Network) architecture to generate 
handwritten digits undistinguishable from the MNIST dataset. Final results of digits which are easily recognizable
by a human.
Code adapted and completed with the instructions provided by Professor Milad Toutounchian, Drexel University.
